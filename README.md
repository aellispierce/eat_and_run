#EAT AND RUN

Find it here:https://eatandrun.herokuapp.com/

Eat and Run is an API that takes two basic parameters: the food you want to eat and your location
The app will then return relevant options for nearby trails where you can burn off the calories.

The vision for an app's UI would be: a glossy picture of the cupcake you want to eat, next to a snapshot of a leafy local trail.  Now working off your food isn't a chore...it is as enticing as your meal.

We will utilize two APIs:
Nutritionix  https://www.mashape.com/msilverman/nutritionix-nutrition-database
TrailAPI  https://www.mashape.com/trailapi/trailapi
